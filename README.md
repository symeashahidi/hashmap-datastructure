# hashmap-datastructure

Portfolio assignment for Data Structures. The HashMap was implemented using a dynamic array approach. For separate chaining, the dynamic array utilizes linked lists and automatically resizes when the load factor reaches or exceeds 1.0. In contrast, the open addressing method employs a dynamic array of HashEntry objects and resolves collisions through quadratic probing.
